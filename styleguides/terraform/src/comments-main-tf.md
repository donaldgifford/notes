# Comments main.tf

Each section (as described in [main.tf](main-tf.md)) of main.tf should have block comments describing the component managed in the section.

Example:

```hcl
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ONE LINE SUMMARY DESCRIBING WHAT IS BEING MANAGED IN THIS SECTION IN ALL CAPS
# The rest of the comments should be in standard casing. This section should contain an overall description of the
# component that is being managed, and highlight any unconventional workarounds or configurations that are in place.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
