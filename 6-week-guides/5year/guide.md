- **AWS**: Well-Architected Framework, re:Invent sessions

## Portfolio Projects to Highlight:

1. **Multi-language microservices** (Go for business logic, Rust for high-performance components)
2. **Performance comparison study** showing when to choose Rust vs Go
3. **WebAssembly integration** demonstrating Rust’s unique capabilities
4. **Complete CI/CD pipeline** with proper Rust tooling and cross-compilation
5. **Infrastructure as Code** using AWS CDK with proper state management

## Why This Rust Focus Makes Sense:

- **Performance-critical services** - Rust excels where Go might hit limits
- **Memory safety** - increasingly important for security-conscious organizations
- **WebAssembly target** - emerging deployment model for edge computing
- **Systems programming** - positions you for infrastructure and platform roles
- **Growing adoption** - companies like AWS, Microsoft, Meta are investing heavily

This plan positions you strongly for Senior Software Engineer or Platform Engineer roles, with Rust giving you a significant differentiator in the market. The combination of Go for rapid development, Rust for performance-critical components, and TypeScript for full-stack capability makes you highly versatile.
