# 15 Year Guide

## 1. Most Important Non-Coding Technologies for 2025

**Platform Engineering & Developer Experience**

- **Backstage** (Spotify’s developer portal) - becoming the standard for internal developer platforms
- **ArgoCD/Flux** - GitOps is now expected, not optional
- **Crossplane** - Infrastructure as Code through Kubernetes APIs, natural evolution from Terraform

**AI/ML Infrastructure**

- **Vector databases** (Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant) - every company is building AI features
- **MLOps platforms** (MLflow, Kubeflow, or Weights & Biases) - AI workloads need proper deployment pipelines
- **NVIDIA Triton** - GPU workload orchestration is becoming critical

**Security & Compliance**

- **Policy as Code** (Open Policy Agent/Gatekeeper) - regulatory compliance through automation
- **Supply chain security** (Sigstore, SLSA framework) - critical for enterprise adoption
- **Service mesh** (Istio or Linkerd) - zero-trust networking is becoming mandatory

## 2. Specific Language Focuses

**Golang (leverage your 5 years)**

- **gRPC-Gateway** and **Connect** - modern API development
- **Cobra CLI** framework - build enterprise-grade CLI tools
- **Go generics** patterns - write more reusable infrastructure code
- **Context patterns** for distributed tracing and cancellation
- **Go modules** advanced dependency management

**Rust (high ROI investment)**

- **Tokio async runtime** - matches your systems background perfectly
- **Axum web framework** - building high-performance APIs
- **Diesel ORM** - database interactions
- **Cargo workspace** management for microservices
- **WebAssembly compilation** - Rust’s killer feature for edge computing

**JavaScript (ecosystem essential)**

- **Node.js with TypeScript** - type safety for backend services
- **Fastify or Hono** - high-performance API frameworks
- **Prisma ORM** - modern database toolkit
- **Next.js API routes** - full-stack development
- **Bun runtime** - emerging fast JavaScript runtime
