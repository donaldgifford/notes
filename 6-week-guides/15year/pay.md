- **Multi-cloud + K8s** expertise essential for senior roles

**Risk Factors:**

- Economic uncertainty may slow hiring at some companies
- Over-saturation in junior/mid-level traditional development roles
- Increasing emphasis on demonstrable impact, not just technical skills

**Recommendation:** The 6-week investment has exceptionally high ROI, especially for the 5-year profile transitioning to senior roles. The 15-year profile gains are more incremental but position for executive technical leadership.

**Bottom Line:**

- **15-year experience:** Expect $40k-$80k increase within 18 months, with potential for much higher at top-tier companies

The key is demonstrating these skills through real projects and impact, not just completing the learning plan.
